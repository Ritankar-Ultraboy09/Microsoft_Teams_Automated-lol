 ***You are required to adjust the mouse pointer location in the Pyautogui.move() . You may use the  Coordinates.py Porogram to find the position of the join button in the     microsoft   teams joining window. You are not supposed to move the window of Microsoft teams , In order to prevent the continous change of the join button Coordinate. The Deafult             Coordinates ar of my PC, So you have to adjust it.

***You are required to run the Join and Leave program together. (If you are running the Flexible Meeting Join)

***https://github.com/Ritankar-Ultraboy09/Microsoft_Teams_Automated-lol/blob/master/(Fixed)automatic_Meeting_Join_For_Microsoft_Teams.py - Meeting Joiner(Fixed), In this you are required to change the secs in time.sleep() according to the duration of our meeting.(Just change the minutes to seconds ) If you are observing that the the meeting you attend regularly has a fixed duartion, I would recommend using this program or else you may use the other one with the leave program.
