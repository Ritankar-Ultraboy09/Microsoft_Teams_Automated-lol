# Microsoft_Teams_Automated-lol
It is a very easy project made by using Python. It is made for the purpose of ease of joining of Meetings and classes in Microsoft teams. 
Simple imported Pyautogui , time and webbrowser and made this easy thing. If you are using it you have to set the coordinates of the mouse pointer. I found it more easy .
